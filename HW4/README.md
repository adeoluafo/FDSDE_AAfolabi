What the homework is about: This homework was mainly about what we learnt in class from the beginning until now in data science. I got to add captions to some figures and tables that were already provided which was done in class. This assignment also covered my understanding of linear regression(univariate and multivariate). What I gained from the assignment: I was able to learn more about multivariate linear regression and linear regressionM in addition, I got more understanding of modeling a dataset. Who I worked with: I worked with Augustina Lorda mainly on the task given, and also got help from Grace Julius in the univarate and multivariate linear regression.
