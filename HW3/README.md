In this Homework, I explored the Happiness dataset and performed similar exercises to the ones that was performed in class.
I also worked on hypothesis testing specifically using the Kolmogorov-Smornoff test (KS-test). I was able to confirm whether the null hypothesis would either be accepted or rejected based on the instructors intruction. 
This homework gave me an eye opener on hypothesis and also tested my previous knowledge on previous class concept as to whether I understood. 
I worked with Grace Juilus and also used online resources for tasks I did not fully understand.
