In this assignment, The task was to write captions for activities already completed by Prof. Bianco. I was able to write captions based on the data and also with the help of external resources. Logistic regression, initializing the model and fitting the model was also asked by the professor. I was able to understand how to give better captions when needed and also learnt more about logistic regression.I worked mainly by myself on this homework.
